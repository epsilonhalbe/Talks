Syntax
======

Uncommon doesn't even grasp it
------------------------------

1. Everything has a type
2. Every number has a bit-size
```haskell
 12 : [8]
```
this number `12` is represented as 8-bit number.

You can find out about the type of something by

```haskell
:t 12
```

There are Bits/Booleans
-----------------------

- True
- False

With the operations

- `&&`, `||`, `if _ then _ else`, `^` (xor), `~`(complement)

Numbers/Words/Characters
------------------------

Cryptol supports only **nonnegative integers** with no upper bound

- default base 16 (reset with `:set base=n` for 0â‰¤nâ‰¤36)
- write with prefixes `0b_`, `0o_`, `0x_` or `0<base>_`

```haskell
> 0<36>cryptol
> 0b1010101
```

But usually one writes characters like 'a','b' and `z`

Tupels
------

```haskell
> ('a',1+3)
> ('a',1,2,3,4)
```

And there are accessors, called projections, written `(1,'c').2`, which work
polymorphic for all tuples. But you can also use pattern matching like
`(one, _ ) = (1, "useless")`, where `_` is the discard variable.

Sequences
---------

Lists in Cryptol are the main workhorse syntax is as usual `[1]` or `[1..10]` or
`[1,3..100]` or `[100,97..1]`. Like any other modern language it has list
comprehensions `[x*y| x <- [1..10], y <- [11,12]]` but we also have parallel
comprehensions, which work like a zip.

```haskell
[(i,j)| i <- [1..10]
      | j <- [10,9..1]] = [(1,10),(2,9),(3,8),..,(10,1)]
```

On Types and Functions
======================

Lists have types too
--------------------

```haskell
[1..10] : [10][64]
```
I am not too happy with that syntax but it means [1..10] is alist of lenght 10
with each element being a 64-bit integer. But this allows for really cool type
level trickery and advanced awsomeness like doing algebra on type level.

Operations on lists
-------------------

We have operators

- `#` = append
- `@` = index
- `@@`= slice
- `!` = reverse index
- `!!`= reverse slice
- `>>` = shift right
- `>>>`= rotate right
- `<<` = shift left
- `<<<`= rotate left

other list functions
--------------------

```haskell
join [[1 .. 4], [5 .. 8], [9 .. 12]]
join [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
transpose [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
transpose [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

Functions and polymorphism
--------------------------

One central piece of functional programming are of course functions, but one
cannot speak of those without mentioning polymorphism.

```haskell
> tail [1..10]
[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
But what type signature has `tail`?

```haskell
>:t tail
tail : {a, n} => [n+1]a -> [n]a
```
i.e. tail takes a list of `(n+1)`-elements of type `a` and spits out a list of
`n`-elements of the same type. Note that `n` does not necessarily need to be finite!

Functions continued
-------------------

But there are functions that have a bit more interesting types

```haskell
>:t split [1..12]
split [0..15] : {Î²,cols,rows} (Î² >= 4, fin Î², fin rows, 16 == cols * row)
                                                              => [cols][rows][Î²]
```

Let us note that this type signature needs a teensy tiny bit explanation

- `Î²` denotes the bit-size; and the interpreter derived correctly that the
largest number in this list (`12`) needs at least 4 bits for representation.
- another thing that the interpreter derived that the length of the list has to
  be the product of the rows and columns you split the list into.

But one grand thing is that cryptol provides syntax to pull type information
down to the function call level with *'backtick'* syntax:

```haskell
> split`{8} [0..15]
[[0,1],[2,3]..[14,15]]
```

Other notable functions used with that syntax are `take`, `drop` and `groupBy`.

Numbers again
-------------

Numbers in cryptol are in reality just nicely printed bit-sequences, therefore
you can use all the list functions for numbers as well!

and then to characters and strings
----------------------------------

```haskell
> :set base=10
> :set ascii=off
> 'A'
65
> "ABC"
[65,66,67]
> 'C' - 'A'
2
```

Zero/Null/Nada
--------------

`zero` is a polymorphic 'value' and represents the number zero in whatever
setting you like. Which is espcially useful with the complement function `~`.

Sweeet as sugar - a.k.a - moar syntax
=====================================

Streams
-------

Often in crypto one encounters stream ciphers which are depicted
<!--![picture](/path/to/picture.jpeg "optional title")-->
and can be written in cryptol as follows

```haskell
as = [0x3F, 0xE2, 0x65, 0xCA] # new
   where [a ^ b ^ c | a <-          as
                    | b <- drop`{1} as
                    | c <- drop`{3} as]
```

Polynomials
-----------

For the AES algorithm one of the basic building blocks is polynomials with
coefficients in $\mathbb F_2$, i.e. $\{1,2\}$.

m a -> (a -> m b) ->  m b
