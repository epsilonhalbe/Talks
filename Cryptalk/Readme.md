Syntax
======

Uncommon doesn't even grasp it
------------------------------

1. Everything has a type
2. Every number has a bitsize
```haskell
 12 : [8]
```
this number `12` is represented as 8-bit number.

There are Bits/Booleans
-----------------------

- True
- False

with the operations

- `&&`, `||`, if â€¦ then â€¦ else, ^ (xor), ~(complement)
